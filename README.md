## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS, BEM methodology
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [BEM](https://en.bem.info/) - BEM Documentation

### What I learned

This is my first project using BEM methodology. BEM makes styling way easier and faster, even if project is that small.

### Continued development

Learning BEM, because it really organizes files tree and work itself.

### Useful resources

- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/guide) - Reminder for setting sass variables.
